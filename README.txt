HotShots is an application for capturing screens and saving them in a variety of image formats as well as adding annotations and graphical data (arrows, lines, texts, ...).
You can also upload your creations to the web (FTP/some web services).
Because HotShots is written with Qt, HotShots runs on Windows, Linux (MacOSX isn't tested yet).
